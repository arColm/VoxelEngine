2 bytes per voxel - id

bind the vao and set vertex attributes to block attributes respectively


Each chunk is WIDTH * HEIGHT * WIDTH -- stored in a straight array

function for generating each face based on a set of vertices
 --> then bind all vertices in chunk to vbo
 --> each chunk has its own VAO
 --> whenever we load a new chunk, we set up its VBOs to its associated VAO.
 --> everytime we render a chunk, we take its VAO --> apply chunk position matrix --> glDrawTriangles
 --> then render the vbo (?)



future optimizations

 - sharing vertices, using EBO ?
